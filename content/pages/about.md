I'm Antje Kazimiers, a scientific associate working in the field of didactics of computer science from Dresden, Germany. During my career as a software engineer, I built web applications with various frameworks, including Python Flask, Django, Drupal and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

From this experience, I strongly believe, tech is an industry full of potential and opportunities for a lot of people and computer science should be taught in a way knowledge becomes easy to learn.
