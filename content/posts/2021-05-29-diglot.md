When I started this blog, I was wondering, whether I should write in German or in English.
Actually I really wanted to write about tech topics in German, because there's a ton
of English content, but there's less in German. You could say, well, Germans usually speak and understand English well enough, especially when it comes
to IT so that should not be a big deal but there's another side to it.

There are a lot of efforts to localize content in science and I think it lowers barriers and deepens understanding if you can read an learn about
something new in your mother tongue.

For instance there are TedX talks in Spanish, French and other languages. There is [HHMI's BioInteractive](https://www.biointeractive.org/es)
effort to provide educational material for the life sciences in Spanish.

But I do want to connect to the world and announce articles on Fosstodon, the mastodon community I joined in January and where I heard first about
#100daystooffload. Fosstodon is an English-speaking community. But it's kind of unfair
to announce an article in English which is finally written in German.

So that's the plan: Articles which I like to announce on Fosstodon will be in English.

_This is day 38 of my [#100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year._
