I found a new computer science lady in youtube who published a very nice video about a typical day in her life, Xiuwen.

{{< youtube jky3y1ijRgc >}}

I like that her schedule differs from the standard one. Xiuwen is not working 9-5pm with a short lunch break and working out at night or in the morning hours, she is finishing up her day early in the afternoon to enjoy the sunlight and do some sports, and then she continues studying at night.

I really do think a similar schedule works best for me. Actually what I know is working is exercising at noon and having lunch afterwards. I am usually very concentrated in the afternoon then and can keep it up quite long. Still I feel like a nice human being at night then. :)

Also, Xiuwen teaches me to drink tea more often and to watch funny videos during the day.
