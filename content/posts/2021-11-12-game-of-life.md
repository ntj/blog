Today I implemented [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with the help of the CMU CS Academy graphics library.

One of those things, I can't stop thinking about, until I get it done.

It works fine for the glider and some of the oscillators but the spaceships don't seem right yet.

It's a powerful library to experiment with algorithms like these, to explore them and create your own environment, rather than just looking at animations found in the web.
