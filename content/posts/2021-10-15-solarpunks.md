Last night I had a conversation about [solarpunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk). I remembered in 2019, I've been to San Diego to attend the DjangoCon conference and TwitchCon was happening at the same time. It was the first time I heard about Twitch and the city was crowded and you saw many people dressed up as steam punks. I think the term steam punk I learned in those days as well.

So I thought, maybe there is a new platform X, I'm not hip enough to know about yet and if there wasn't a pandemic solar punks meet at Xcon, the platform's conference. Or maybe the conference is taking place online and this is already happening.
