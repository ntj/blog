I'm now past 50 articles as part of 100daystooffload, in Germany we would say, ich bin übern Berg, beyond Bergfest. Bergfest you celebrate when you're in the middle of something, half of any kind of project is over. 

I think the first 50 articles were the easiest. I really did want to have a blog for a long long time. Especially when I worked with CRM and started working on things where I clearly could not find any explanation online, how to do a certain thing, I thought, I could just write the first explanation myself and publish it. Meanwhile you can find explanations, how to use Angular in Dynamics CRM.

But my blog project never came to life. I think I doubted I could keep it up and publish articles on a regular basis.

But the whole setting of 100daystooffload is different. Quality doesn´t matter as much as publishing regularily.

I think it's a nice experiment and I believe I can finish the challenge until the end of January. But I also realized at some point, that I just stepped in the trap of hustle culture, doing a lot, and being super productive, so this very typical cultural thing you get into when you'r working in tech.

_This is day 61 of my [#100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year._
