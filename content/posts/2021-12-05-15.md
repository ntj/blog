I need to write 15 more articles to complete the challenge 100daystooffload. I like to get it done as early as possible, in December still would be best.

It's a great adventure and I can see the benefit, it helped let things go. But since time is running out, it's less fun now, than it was month ago.

I still have a lot of respect of people who blog every day, can make it a habit. I'm not sure if I even would commit to 50 articles in a year just for fun after this challenge.

I think things now become less tech related and more random

_This is day 85 of my [#100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year._
