Today is the last day of rC3 -- I liked the congress a lot. Much was different, not only because it took place remotely again.

I checked one more time, [fefe](https://blog.fefe.de/) hasn't blogged about the congress yet, he always did I believe. Frank Rieger twittered once, there won't be a Fnord News Show just because it's less fun without the audience.

I wonder if there's some more behind it. To show the club is changing, to give the next gen more visibility. I had so much fun being part of the congress myself, not just go there and watch. To have a space to go to. To have friends to meet and hang out with.

_This is day 95 of my [#100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) series, a challenge to write 100 blog posts in a year._
