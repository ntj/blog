In a few days the rC3 NOWHERE begins, the annual congress of the Chaos Computer Club. This time again remotely.

The FSFE Women work on their spot on the map, and I hope I can translate a few talks again with the lingo team.

Looking back, Tom and I must have been to the congresses 26C3 - 29C3. We never stayed all days, usually two days and booked a room in a hotel.

Once or twice we took the last train from Berlin to Cottbus at night. The train leaves around 1am, arrives at 2.30am and then we walked an hour to my parents house. :)

I liked congress time a lot. Such a cool mix of science, tech and topics which matter for society. 3D Printing and self-made things everywhere.

If you can, reserve your tickt for the 2D world! All information you can find here
