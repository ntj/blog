I am ambitious. I want to be successful in my job and like to have a happy and fullfilling personal life. For a long time, I thought both can be achieved if I just spend enough time on fullfilling my goals.

Now I think, mental well-being plays a more important role. Avoiding situations and people, who let you down, trying to build up a network of support, working on inner strength.

I hope I can find the discipline to master life and see some kind of light again, which brings out happiness.
