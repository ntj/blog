Probably, I moving my account away from Fosstodon to another instance of the Fediverse in a couple of weeks.

The reason is, Fosstodon is an English speaking community but I am the apointee for social media of the Freie Software Freunde e.V. and in that role I am announcing monthly meetings, which take place in German.

So not sure yet where to go, social.technics.de maybe or some other knot. It's interesting to have a choice though.
