Soon I am going to move my account from fosstodon to another instance of the Fediverse.

Because fosstodon is an English speaking community but I am accouncing monthly meetings of the Freie Software Freunde e.V. in case we host a talk, which are conducted in German.

So not sure yet where to go to, @social.tchncs.de maybe or some other knot. It's interesting to have a choice though.
