It took me 339 days do complete the challenge. I wrote about programming and people I find inspiring, about communities, which mean something to me or did in the past. Also about platforms where you can get in touch with other people.

I think I learned a few things along the way, writing a blog post was a motivation to try something which could eventually help me for my job. Summarize sth. and put it in own words gives me a way to look up and recall terms and concepts. Also it helped to let things to.

I just can recommend to try it out yourself! Either privately in a journal, or by participating in that challenge.

So my blogging project will pause. I feel like writing there are other options, like working on another Wikipedia article.
