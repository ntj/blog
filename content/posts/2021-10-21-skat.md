One of the nicest things I've done is having been a meetup organizer for a card game playing group for 5 years. We meet about once in a month in different restaurants and bistros in the city and really put some thoughts in our accouncements of the platform, too.

The group is gone now, just to much money to spend to keep it alive just so.

But I saved some of pictures and annoucements, so I thougt maybe this is my page in memory of this Skat club.
