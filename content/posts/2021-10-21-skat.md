One of the nicest things I've done is being a meetup organizer for a card game group for five years. We met once in a month in different restaurants in the city and really put some thoughts in our announcements on the platform as well.

The group is gone now, just to much money to spend to keep it alive just so.

But I saved some of pictures and announcements, so I thought, maybe this is my page in memory of this Skat club.

I'm thankful to my former Co-Organizer, who encouraged me to start the group. I would not have done this without his encouragement.
