Some fascincating aspect of CS comes from the need to name new stuff. Languages, frameworks, concepts. 

 It striked me again when I first head about [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). So funny to name a tool like this, very appealing. My new package manager in Arch Linux is called yay -- same thing here.

 Names often relate to something or someone. Python to Monty Python and Django to the guitarist Django Reinhard. I believe inventors and creators come up with names like these to show their appreciation and to create little worlds they enjoy being in.

I wish there are more tools where I would say, wow that's a cool name. If I name a language or a framework, what would be heroes I would refer to?

Momo .. the protagonist of Michael Endes novel .. maybe. Or some kind of veggies I like, leek or asparagus. Not easy to come up with anything immediately.
